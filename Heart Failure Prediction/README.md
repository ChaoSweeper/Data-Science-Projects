# Heart Failure Prediction Project

## Introduction:
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has heart failure or not. The data is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). The main goal of this project is to learn how to use machine learning models to predict the outcome of a problem.

## Data:
| Features | Description | DType |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Age | age of the patient | int64 |
| Sex | sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female] | object |
| ChestPainType | chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic] | object |
| RestingBP | resting blood pressure [mm Hg] | int64 |
| Cholesterol | serum cholesterol [mm/dl] | int64 |
| FastingBS | fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise] | int64 |
| RestingECG | resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria] | object |
| MaxHR |  maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202] | int64 |
| ExerciseAngina | exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No] | object |
| Oldpeak | oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression] | float64 |
| ST_Slope | the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping] | object |
| HeartDisease | output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal] | int64 |


### Notes:
I look forward to return to this project in the future. I am not sure if I can use the data in this project to improve my machine learning skills or not. The models I did use in this project did not yield the best results. This leads me to believe that the data is not sufficient to train a model. Or my skill for building machine learning models is not sufficient.
